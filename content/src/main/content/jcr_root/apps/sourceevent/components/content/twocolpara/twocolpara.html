	<h3>What is Source?</h3>
		<div class="left">
		Over the last 3 years, the number of Australian developers working on projects with Adobeâ€™s Marketing Cloud technology has grown larger and larger.  Source is a conference in Sydney focused on the Australian community that promises a chance to network, learn new things, and have a bit of fun at the same time. 
		</div>
		<div class="right">
		Over two days in November you will hear the latest from Adobe Product Managers & Consultants as well as from members of the local community. There will be a combination of the usual presentations (with lots of code and limited PowerPoint!) as well as lightning talks. We want to hear from you as well!
